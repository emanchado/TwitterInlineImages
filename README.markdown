DEPRECATED
==========

This extension is deprecated. It hasn't worked for a while but I don't have the time nor the inclination to fix it.
Besides, it was written for Opera 12 so it will not work (I guess?) on Opera >= 15.

Twitter Inline Images
=====================

[Twitter Inline Images](https://addons.opera.com/addons/extensions/details/twitter-inline-images/)
is a very simple
[Opera extension](https://addons.opera.com/addons/extensions/) that
shows images inline on Twitter. It's basically
[ayosec](https://github.com/ayosec)'s
"[Show images in tweets](https://gist.github.com/1073923)" gist code
turned into an Opera extension.
